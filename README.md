DataFun-07-ML
Project Overview
This project focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques to explore and analyze data. We aim to implement various algorithms and visualize the results using a guided approach through Jupyter Notebooks. This repository will serve as a demonstration of basic machine learning workflows, including data preparation, model building, and evaluation.

As we progress, we will utilize popular Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and others to perform essential machine learning tasks. This repository includes the setup instructions, packages required, and steps to run the project locally.

Technologies and Tools
Python 3.x
JupyterLab
GitHub for version control
Virtual environment for managing dependencies
Python Libraries
numpy (for numerical computations)
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib (for data visualization)
seaborn (for statistical plots)
scipy (for scientific computations)
pyarrow (for reading and writing parquet files)
Project Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, first, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/datafun-07-ml.git
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
In your project folder, create a virtual environment to isolate the required packages:

bash
Copy code
py -m venv .venv
Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the following command based on your OS:

Windows:

bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Step 4: Install Required Packages
After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
py -m pip install jupyterlab numpy pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn scipy
Step 5: Open JupyterLab
Once all dependencies are installed, open JupyterLab to begin working on the notebooks:

bash
Copy code
jupyter lab
Step 6: Set the Python Interpreter in VS Code
If you're using VS Code, set the correct Python interpreter by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and selecting Python: Select Interpreter. Choose the interpreter from the .venv virtual environment.
